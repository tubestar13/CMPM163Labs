For the first cube on the left I created a sky blue cube with lambert material and changed the emission to a red color.

For the second cube is a phong material cube with a green shine

For the third cube, it is an interpolation of spring bud and sky blue using the uVu's z coordinate 

For the fourth cube it is an interpolation of interpolating Olive and Dark Cyan using the uVu's z coordinate and interpolating Citrus and Iris Blue using the uVu's y coordinate using the uVu's x coordinate.
